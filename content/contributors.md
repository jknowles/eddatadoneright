his PhD in Sociology with a focus on educational inequality and civic outcomes

### Clare Waterman Irwin

She's got some serious quant chops, specializes in measurement, and manages to
balance quantitative and qualitative methods with the kind of acumen and grace
most of us can only aspire toward. Plus, she's a distance runner, so you know
this woman has what it takes to do the really hard stuff. Just sayin'.

with.
