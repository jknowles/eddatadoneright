Lindsey Brownson

Lindsey is a recent graduate of the Vermont College of Fine Arts MFA in Writing and Publishing program, where she practiced across genres but concentrated in creative non-fiction.  Her final thesis project was a 108-page memoir in essays titled Why Are You So Emo. She was a fiction reader and a member of the copyediting staff for the 2018 edition of Hunger Mountain, VCFA’s annual literary journal.

She considers it a privilege to have other writers hand their hard work to her with implicit trust, and couldn’t have been more excited to help with this project.
