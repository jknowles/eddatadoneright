As the first Director of the Data Management & Analysis Division, at Vermont's
Agency of Education, Wendy serves alongside her Work Family of Data Scientists
as a centralized resource to the Vermont Agency of Education. Her crew collects,
stewards, and leverages the institution's critical data assets to create and
share data products that enable empirically-based practice and policy
decision-making.

Her Division leads, partners with external bodies, and executes on the analytic
activities of the institution as well as plans, develops, and manages the data
governance program and the business side of the DataOps continuum. They're a
busy bunch!

Her Ph.D. (2011) is in sociology from the [National University of Ireland
Maynooth](www.nuim.ie) where she was a doctoral fellow at the [National Institute
for Regional and Spatial Analysis](www.nuim.ie/nirsa). Her dissertation findings
highlighted shifting demographics in education arenas and labor markets
internationally, specific education orientations occurring across cultures, and
presented thoughts on the social and spatial forces surrounding rural community
viability.

Since leaving academia, she has dedicated herself to creating the cultural,
infrastructural, and operational conditions needed to care for and use data
sustainably so as to provide value-added analyses in the public sector.

She believes in harnessing science for the public good, there's no point to
unsalted butter, it's cool to be kind, and that she's really lucky Jared and DJ
both agreed to be her friend. She feels smarter just standing next to them,
whether in person or virtually.

### Dorothyjean (DJ) Cratty


DJ conducts student-level research studies for and with state and district
agencies and their stakeholders through [DJC Applied Research.](https://www.djcappliedresearch.com) Included in these
are equity audits and research capacity audits. She helps states and districts
develop and improve their researcher practitioner partnerships (RPPs), advises
RPP grant programs on state and district needs, and trains university research
partners on collaborative data analytic methods. She also conducts research with
education and labor data aggregates for national organizations, such as EdTrust.
 
Previously, DJ led statewide RPP capacity development as principal investigator
for Rhode Island's cross-sector Research Hub, and more recently, the education
data audit stage of DC's new RPP. She also built out North Carolina's
cross-sector research capacity as the data and methods specialist on the state
data interdisciplinary research team at Duke University. Her research with state
administrative data includes preschool, K-12, postsecondary, workforce, CTE,
adult education, teacher workforce, course data, and school climate.
 
As a program officer for the NCES Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems (SLDS)
grant program, DJ worked with state agency data and research managers to help
develop and share best practices for applied research with P-20W+ sector data.
These practices included crafting research agendas, drafting data sharing
agreements, documenting data inventories, training analytic staff, and
presenting rigorous research to lay audiences.
 
Her training is in labor and public economics. She has worked with state
administrative labor data to research workers' compensation reforms and labor
productivity. Prior to working primarily with state and district administrative
data, she conducted applied research with survey data for various countries and
sectors as an economist at the World Bank. Journal publications include
Economics of Transition and Economics of Education Review.
 
To read some of DJ's EDDR-related work, check out her [Duke statewide education
research papers](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=1589079) with copious data prep and analysis details.

Jared is the president of [Civilytics Consulting](www.civilytics.com), an independent data
science company that provides social science research and analysis, software
solutions, and training in the K12 education, higher education, criminal
justice, and public finance sectors. He founded Civilytics in 2016 to pursue his
passion of providing high-quality public performance metrics for government
services. He works with state and local education agencies, networks of
education analysts, community groups, and others to provide clear, transparent,
open, and impactful analytic solutions that meet users' needs. Jared is known
for his deep expertise working with practitioners, focus on making data analysis
and evaluation results accessible and actionable, and commitment to
user-centered design and communication.

Jared formerly served as a senior research analyst with the Wisconsin Department
of Public Instruction. There he led the design and deployment of the Wisconsin
Dropout Early Warning System (DEWS), a machine learning predictive framework
available to all schools serving students grades 5-9 in the state. At DPI, he
was committed to growing state staff's data literacy and statistical computing
skills, leading dozens of training workshops, and to building partnerships with
other agencies and groups, serving on a variety of state advisory councils. He
also led several internal analysis efforts culminating in presenting findings to
agency leadership, legislators, school leaders, teachers, and the public.

Jared completed his PhD in political science at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison in 2015. There he was a fellow in an Institute of Education
Sciences pre-doctoral training program at the Wisconsin Center for Education
Research. Jared is also an avid photographer and loves to travel and play

LaCole Foots is a performance manager for the Texas Education Agency where she
serves by helping to manage the strategic initiatives that interact with the
students, campuses and districts throughout the state. She assists with aligning
the agenc's strategic plans and daily operations by creating and tracking
metrics, briefing senior leadership on the progression of initiatives, and
making recommendations for tactical changes.

Completing her Master of Science in Public Policy and Management at Carnegie
Mellon's Australian campus allowed her the chance to see compulsory voting in
action and informed her truest career passion: the intersection of civic
engagement and education. 'How do we teach kids about their role in government
and how does that affect their engagement as adults?' Finding answers to these
questions is a core professional motivation and she hopes to continue pursuing
it in an academic setting at some point.

Further, LaCole is in the exploratory phase of launching a consulting practice
that will coach clients on the interconnectedness of data strategy, program
evaluation, strategic planning and project management. As a certified Project
Management Professional (PMP) and a former enterprise architect, she focuses on
the convergence of data systems and program evaluation along with the best way
to use data to inform strategic and tactical maneuvering. The soup-to-nuts
offering will help service-based industries (public sector and non profit)
develop an idea into a well regimented and monitored program with a
prioritization of disrupting inequitable systems.

When not thinking of ways to absolutely change the world, you can find LaCole
hiking with her dog Cora or writing poetry about the beautiful Austin sky.

Justin currently serves as a research analyst for the Policy and Budget team at
the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction (WDPI). In that role, he's
devoted a lot of time to producing predictive models. He created the [College
and Career Readiness Early Warning System
(CCREWS)](https://dpi.wi.gov/ews/college-career-readiness) to provide early
predictions of student college enrollment and ACT results so that schools can
provide additional support to those that need it and thereby increase the
numbers of students who are ready for college and career. He also created a
system to provide Advanced Placement exam predictions so that schools can
identify students who are likely to be successful at AP but who aren't currently
participating. In addition to the predictive projects, he's conducted both ad
hoc and planned analyses, worked on data governance and confidential data
sharing, and designed, administered, and reported on surveys.

Before that, he was a consultant for the Office of Educational Accountability at
the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction. In that role, he worked on all
aspects of the Wisconsin school and district accountability report cards,
modernized the Title III Annual Measurable Achievement Objectives accountability
reports for English learners, created numerous reproducible processes to
accomplish tasks that had previously been done by hand, and conducted ad hoc
analyses to meet decision-support and reporting needs.

Not only this, but he has also served as a researcher for a non-profit education
organization, including the full cycle of program evaluation from recruiting
pilot and control schools and administering exams to conducting analysis and
developing reports. As an independent contractor, he has conducted program
evaluation analyses and produced Shiny dashboards. Not to mention, that he's
kind of an all-around good guy.  Because he values supporting new analysts and
building community, he created [RProgramming.net](http://rprogramming.net/) and
founded the MadR Madison R Meetup group which he led for three years. No flies
on him!
