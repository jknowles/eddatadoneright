### Who are We and Why this Book?

Well, in short, we are probably a lot like you. We are all academically trained social scientists
who studied hard and then transitioned to working in education agencies 
[you can get our full bios here](/authors).

We met up at the STATS-DC conference hosted by NCES one day where we found each other through our
shared griping about some of the blind spots we saw in how data were being used for decision-making
in K-12 education.

From a shared moment of recognition in a too-cold DC hotel conference room to a dinner and drinks
conversation afterwards, we realized we’d found our Tribe and we decided to do something. We formed
an organization known as DATA-COPE (Data Analysis Technical Assistance Community of Practice in
Education - catchy right?  Yeah, we know, there are a lot of words).  We formed the group as a
gathering place for others like us -- analysts working in this field who saw the disconnect between
their academic training and the needs of their organization.

Over the years, at subsequent conferences and via phone calls in-between, we realized that our
experience was shared across the country, and that there were talented, thoughtful, smart analysts
working in isolation in education agencies all across the country. It became clear through our
conversations on our online user-group forum that there was great demand for a good resource others
could reference and share, and we realized was a good use of our time.

It wouldn’t be honest of us if we ignored the fact that a big motivation for writing the book was
our collective frustration with so much of the commentary that is out there about education data
analysis. We’ve read research reports that ignored key data definitions, excluded records by mistake
or without justification, or derived a variable by adding together two misinterpretations of other
variables -- all with data we had spent years of our professional lives shaping, analyzing, and
understanding.

It troubled us that big policy decisions were being made based on regression results built on shaky
analytical samples. This happened not out of any malicious intent, but out of a lack of
understanding -- an understanding that we knew was quietly shared by our (mostly unsung) peers
across the country. So, we decided it was time to get loud about it and encourage folks everywhere
to do better science.

And that’s the thing about education data analysts working in public service -- we’re mostly a quiet
bunch (people who know Wendy will laugh at this sentence).
