title: Education Data Done Right
---

You. Yes, you there. Isn’t it exciting? You are sitting down at your desk at your new job as an
education data analyst. You’ve been trained in so many statistical methods, you’re a wizard with R
or Stata, you can adjust standard errors with the best of them -- you’ve got this. Plus, now that
you are working at an education agency you don’t have to sift through a tedious IRB and data request
process -- you can get started right away doing powerful analyses that will improve the decision
making of your agency.

As you turn on the computer and drink your coffee, you are filled with anticipation. You’ve already
requested all of the longitudinal assessment data from IT so you can get a jump start. You open your
email, eager to download the data and get started, but instead you see:

> “About that request for data -- we’ll need you to be part of a data governance discussion with us.
The attached data includes a number of shifting definitions and cannot be used for year to year
comparisons at this time.”

Data what? Definitions? The field names are all the same, so what’s the problem here? You take a
deep breath and Google “Education data governance” and now, you’re here.

Welcome. 

We’ve all been there.

Let’s talk about what comes next.
